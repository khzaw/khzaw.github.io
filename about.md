My name is Kaung Htet and I am currently a software engineer in an art startup called [ARTO Gallery](http://arto.gallery) here in Singapore. I graduated from __**National University of Singapore**__ with a degree in Computer Science.

My interests cross Open-Source, Programming languages, Functional programming, Algorithms &amp; Web development. Also a typography nerd with a thing for condensed typefaces.

Photography is a big part of my life and my life has changed dramatically ever since I picked up my first DSLR.

As the year comes to a close, I would like to take a moment to reflect on 2015. Looking back, it will mostly be remembered as the year I dealt with depression and self-esteem issues. Other than the endeavour to conquer my inner demons, I made a couple of new friends and acquaintances, lost some, burnt some bridges, built new ones, discovered new pastimes and grew out of some old ones. In the grand scheme of things, it wasnâ€™t a very fruitful year as I wished it would be.

Nevertheless, here are some of the great things that I discovered, learned, read, etc. No particular ordering is implied unless specifically stated so.

This doesn’t just happen when you or she changes. Sometimes, something innocuous about her circumstances can change, without any fault of yours. Like she moves to a new country, go to a new school with a new clique of friends and likes one of them. She feels attraction towards another man. If she were _really_ in love with you, she wouldn’t feel about another man. So, she suddenly realises that she hasn’t been in love with you for a long time and hasn’t been happy in ages.

You didn’t change. You didn’t screw up. She just got attracted elsewhere. The light switch is not a dimmer, but a toggle. It doesn’t go from hot to warm. It turns on or turns off from hot to bitter cold, seemingly overnight. Instantaneous.

I have always had an interest in photography but up until August of 2016, I didn't have the means to pursure it to my heart's content. Ever since I picked up my first DSLR, my life has changed. I have never been more liberated and my life has been more meaningful and fulfilling and photography was one of the most pivotal reasons that cured my depression.

I started my photography journey with taking landscapes. Since Singapore is a tiny city state with very little opportunites for natural landscapes, I moved on to taking cityscapes. Over time, I have started to see the beauty behind portraiture and street photography. And lately, I have been shooting a lot of portraiture as well mostly because it forces me to come out of my introverted shell.

Most of my work can be seen on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/khzaw) and [FB Page](https://facebook.com/khzawphotography).

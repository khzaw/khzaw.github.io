I have always had an interest in photography but up until August of 2016, I didn't have the means to pursure it to my heart's content. Ever since I picked up my first DSLR, my life has changed. I have never been more liberated and my life has been more meaningful and fulfilling and photography was one of the most pivotal reasons that cured my depression.

I started my photography journey with taking landscapes. Since Singapore is a tiny city state with very little opportunites for natural landscapes, I moved on to taking cityscapes. Over time, I have started to see the beauty behind portraiture and street photography. So, if somebody asks me what do you shoot, my answer as of now is "Cityscapes and Street Photography. And I have started shooting portraits as well."
